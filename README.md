# Contributing to Our MVC Project

Welcome to our MVC project repository! We're building a robust framework with a focus on database management, routing (using `App.php`), and application logic. Your contributions are valuable to help us improve and expand our MVC framework.

## Project Overview

Our MVC framework is designed to facilitate web application development, emphasizing:

- **Database Management:** Utilizing PDO for secure database operations (CRUD).
- **Routing and Middleware:** Configuring routes and managing application flow with `App.php`.
- **Form Handling and Validation:** Ensuring robust form submissions and data integrity.

## Current Challenges

### Issue: Form Submission Redirects Unnecessarily

We're currently facing an issue where form submissions redirect to the `store` function even when data isn't successfully submitted. Ideally, we want the application to stay on the `create` function if data validation or submission fails.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in various areas, including but not limited to:

- **Database Operations:** Enhancing CRUD functionalities, optimizing database queries.
- **Routing and Middleware:** Improving route handling, middleware implementation.
- **Form Handling:** Implementing better form validation and error handling.
